## On The Fly

My idea is a simple restaurant application to manage a newly opened or already established restaurant.

I want to end old methods of upkeeping restaurants with a free open source web application that will show live data overtime.

-MVP features
A bar inventory calculator that provides tracking of storing, receiving, and ending inventory.

Also calculate cost of goods sold, break-points, and gross profit.

-Post MVP features

implement a 'host stand' to set and reserve tables.

add inventory managing for the back of the house.
